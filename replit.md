## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (based on visible HTML structure)
- **Design Pattern**: Single-page application with card-based UI components
- **Styling Approach**: Embedded CSS with modern design principles including:
  - CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layouts
  - Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
  - Box shadows and hover effects for interactive elements
  - Mobile-first responsive design with viewport meta tag

### UI/UX Design Decisions
- **Card-based Layout**: Uses `.card` components with rounded corners and shadows for content organization
- **Modern Typography**: Implements Segoe UI font stack for cross-platform compatibility
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover animations with `translateY` transforms for enhanced user experience
- **Color Scheme**: Purple gradient background (`#667eea` to `#764ba2`) with white content cards

### Component Structure
- **Container System**: Centered layout with max-width constraints for optimal readability
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly approach with proper viewport configuration
- **Modular CSS**: Organized with reset styles and component-specific styling

## External Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
- **Fonts**: System fonts (Segoe UI, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif stack)
- **No External Libraries**: Pure vanilla implementation without framework dependencies

### Potential Future Dependencies
Based on the contact extraction functionality, the application may require:
- **File Processing Libraries**: For handling various document formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- **Data Validation**: For contact information verification
- **Export Capabilities**: For generating output files in different formats
- **API Integrations**: Potentially for contact validation services or CRM integrations

Note: The repository appears to be in early development stage with only basic HTML structure visible. Additional JavaScript functionality and backend components may be added as the project evolves.
